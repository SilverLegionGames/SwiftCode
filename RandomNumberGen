This code snippet allows random number generation in swift.
I will put comments in "*" so you dont get confused.

*Code:*
arc4random_uniform(1...1000)

*Now lets break this down.*

arc4random

*This generates a random, unsigned 32 bit number.*
*Just, think of it as, unsigned = number is temporary, and 32 bit = max number is 2147483647.*
*However this is not it, all you need.*

_uniform

*This makes the numbers a bit more randomised and reliable/realistic, so you get a random number,*
*but the numbers are more reliable*

(1...1000)

*This part is where you include the range, minimum being 1 , and maximum being 2147483647 (since its 32 bit), must use THREE periods to show it's a range*

*Once all this code is complete everytime you run this function it will return an unsigned integer within your range *
*to you, however next you must make it signed simpley by assigning to a variable, and then making the variable an integer*

*Finalized code to get a random number*

var unsignedRandomNumber = arc4random_uniform(1...1000)
var randomNumber = Int(unsignedRandomNumber)

*You must then turn the unsignedRandomNumber from the arc4random_uniform code into an integer to use it, simply by putting Int(variableName assigned to the function)*
